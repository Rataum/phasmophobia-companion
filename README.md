An unofficial companion app to the amazing horror game by Kinetic Games, Phasmophobia.

Currently users can look through the in-game journal and narrow down the type of ghost by marking the evidence collected. There are plans to add more features such as a score calculator (money per objective), and a table of items with their corresponding prices. 
Accepting issues for feature requests and pulll requests.

Phasmophobia Companion is currently only available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phasmophobiacompanion)
